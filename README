1. Install the vpnc command which you must download separately.

2. Edit /etc/vpnc/gvpnc.conf per the group id, group password, and user id that 
   you have been given by your VPN admin at your office.

3. Install Python and PyGTK if your distribution of Linux does not already
   include this.

4. Install gksudo

5. Run the gvpnc command.  Click the Connect button or menu item.
   Fill in the dialog items for your VPN connection. Then click Connect. If you have not used sudo in
   a while, you will be prompted for your password.  Then there will be some delay as vpnc connects
   (and possibly the window will grey-out for a while).  Then if all goes well
   you should see Connected status.  The application may be left open or terminated (vpnc will not
   exit if the GUI exits).  When you are done using the VPN click the Disconnect button.


All configuration files will be stored in $HOME/.config/gvpnc and will be readable 
only by the user (umask 0066) for security, as passwords will be stored in them. (see the TODO file)
