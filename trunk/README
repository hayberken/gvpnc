1. Install the vpnc command which you must download separately.

2. Install Python and PyGTK if your distribution of Linux does not already
   include this.

3. Install gksudo

4. Run the gvpnc command.  Click the Connect button or menu item.
   Fill in the dialog items for your VPN connection. Then click Connect. If you have not used sudo in
   a while, you will be prompted for your password.  Then there will be some delay as vpnc connects
   (and possibly the window will grey-out for a while).  Then if all goes well
   you should see Connected status.  The application may be left open or terminated (vpnc will not
   exit if the GUI exits).  When you are done using the VPN click the Disconnect button.

If you don't want to run gvpnc from your home directory, you can put it in your system directory.
Any one of the following 3 places would be ideal:
  * /opt/gvpnc -- just put all files there and put it on your path or just give the full path to run it.
  * /usr/local/ -- put gvpnc in /usr/local/bin and gvpnc.glade in /usr/local/share/gvpnc/
  * /usr -- same as above, but without the /local/ parts.
      Note: This is normally not a good idea for software that does not come with your distro.

All configuration files will be stored in $HOME/.config/gvpnc and will be readable
only by the user (umask 0066) for security, as passwords will be stored in them. (see the TODO file)
